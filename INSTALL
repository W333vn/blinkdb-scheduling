Installation instructions for scheduler.

Notes:
1. Currently, I have only been able to compile on Linux, specifically Ubuntu 12.04.  All these instructions assume you are using a blank install of Ubuntu 12.04.  I haven't been able to get python-zibopt to compile on Mac.
2. These steps are mostly copied from the python-zibopt installation guide here: http://code.google.com/p/python-zibopt/wiki/Installation
    My main contribution is finding out that they don't work on Macs!
3. $HOME below refers to the directory containing this file.

Steps:
1. Download python-zibopt from: http://code.google.com/p/python-zibopt/downloads/detail?name=python-zibopt-0.7.2.dev-r226.tar.gz&can=2&q=
2. Download zibopt-2.1.1 from: http://scip.zib.de/download.php?fname=ziboptsuite-2.1.1.tgz
3. Install the following Debian packages: build-essential, python-dev, python-setuptools, zlibc, libgmp10.
4. Install python-algebraic: easy_install python-algebraic
5. Unzip zibopt-2.1.1 and run: make ziboptlib SHARED=true ZIMPL=false ZLIB=false READLINE=false
6. Copy lib/libzibopt-2.1.1.linux.x86_64.gnu.opt.so to ./lib in this project and create a symlink to it named ./lib/libzibopt.so.
7. Allow python-zibopt to reference the libraries and sources when you compile it:
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/lib
  export LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/lib
  export C_INCLUDE_PATH=~/src/ziboptsuite-2.1.1/scip-2.1.1/src/
  Note: You need to have LD_LIBRARY_PATH set as above whenever you run this project.  The other two are needed only for compiling python-zibopt.
8. Unzip python-zibopt and enter its directory.
9. Apply a patch to setup.py in python-zibopt: patch -p0 setup.py < ../python-zibopt-setup-patch.diff
10. Edit setup.py and set BASEDIR to $HOME/lib .
11. Build python-zibopt by running: sudo python setup.py build && sudo python setup.py install
